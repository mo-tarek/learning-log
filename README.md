# Journey of a Non-CS Student

I am excited to embark on my journey to learn the C programming language!

## Reflections on Learning

- To truly learn something new, one must engage with it actively.
- While aiming to learn a language like C++, gaining a deep understanding necessitates practical application.
- I resonate with the following quote:
  > "What I can't create, I don't understand." â€” Richard Feynman

I am ready to dive in, experiment, and grasp the concepts as I progress. I look forward to seeing where this journey takes me!
