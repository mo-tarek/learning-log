# Journey of non-cs student 
<p> I will start this journey by learning C programming language!</p>
<p>My thoughts about learning: </p>
<ul>
    <li>If you want to learn something new, you should get your hands dirty with it.</li>
    <li>Let's say you want to learn language like C++, you have the chance to learn it with its creator, you will not it without applying what you have learned</li>
    <li>
        I really like these quotes
            <li>What I can't create I don't understand  -- Feynman</li>
    </li>
</ul>
